In this cases, the error pipeline give you an option to configure extended behavior in case messages are failing."},{key:"Resolver Pipeline",value:"A special pipeline used by services to process messages before sending them on the wire to external systems or forwarding them into further processing inside of NEXUSe2e. e.g. A HTTPSenderService as a generic component can be configured with a ebxml resovler pipeline to behave as a EbxmlSenderService."},{key:"Pipelet",value:"A single discrete piece of code that can be chained with other pieces to achieve the functionality you want to configure for your business process."},{key:"Route",value:"One route describes the connection between two partners.

Therefore we added the concept of a Container of certificates. This containers bundle certificates for you and they can be referenced in the configuration. This way, you only reference the container once and change the content of the container at any time without needing to keep track of all the references to it.

And after all this, we want to make sure a couple of phrases aren't missed above but were actually removed from the concepts in NEXUSe2e.

- Frontend and Backend: Yes it took some time but eventually we learned, its not only confusing but also not necessary at all.
- Persistent Properties: These are replaced by the Key Value Properties. The behavior is more or less the same.
- TRP: the transport/routing/protocol configuration got removed in favor of the routes. They replace the existing options and adding some new options as well.
- Roles: Roles are not really gone but got be summarized as default rules within NEXUSe2e. Now you have System Administrator, Administrator and Report. This might change over time, but we want to keep it as simple as possible.
