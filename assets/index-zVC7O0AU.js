### Configure Partner & Choreography

To ensure NEXUSe2e will accept incoming HTTP plain messages you need a configured partner. You can use an excisting partner or create a new. This Partner needs to be in the choreography of the action you want to use.

#### Configure Partner

If you want to use an excisting partner you can skip this step.

Switch to following menu point in the NEXUSe2e Admin GUI:

    NEXUSe2e > Collaboration Partners

And click on "Add Collaboration Partner".

In the next screen fill least a Partner ID and confirm with "Save".



#### Configure Partner Connection for Receive Only

If you only want to receive HTTP plain messages, without answering with an ackkowledgement or sending a messages by your own, you don't need a correctly configured connection.

Switch to following menu point in your NEXUSe2e Admin GUI:

    NEXUSe2e > Collaboration Partners > YourPartner > Connections

Click on new "Add Connection" and follow these instructions:

  1. Add a connection name and add localhost to connection URL.

Switch to following menu point in your NEXUSe2e Admin GUI:

    NEXUSe2e > Collaboration Partners > YourPartner > Connections

  1. Add a distinct connection name and a valid connection URL.
  2. Choose the TRP you are planning to use.

Switch to following menu point in your NEXUSe2e Admin GUI:

    NEXUSe2e > Choreographies > httpPlain > Participants > Add Participant

And do as instructed:

  1. Choose your desired Partner ID.
  2. Choose the connection you configured.
