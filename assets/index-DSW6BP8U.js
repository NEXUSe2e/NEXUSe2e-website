There might alternatives using other tools than OpenSSL.\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. OpenSSL needs to be installed on your system (wherever you intend to create the keystore file, does not have to be server running NEXUSe2e). There are Windows installers available for OpenSSL.\n2. private key file (usually a `.key` or `.pem` file) -> e.g. `private.pem`\n  - If you have a pfx or p12 file, you can extract the private key certificate using [KeyStore Explorer](https://keystore-explorer.org). Use option: "OpenSSL - no encryption" while exporting the private key.\n3. certificate file (usually a `.crt` or `.pem` file) -> e.g. `cert.cer`\n  - If you have a pfx or p12 file, you can extract the certificate using KeyStore Explorer.\n4. pem file with complete certificate chain including you certificate and all ca certificates (your certificate firs, root certificate last) -> e.g. `clientcertchain.pem`\n  - If you have a pfx or p12 file, you can extract the ca certificates using KeyStore Explorer.\n  - You can use Powershell to create the chain pem file, e.g.: ```Get-Content cert.cer, int.cer, root.cer | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 clientcertchain.pem```\n\n### OpenSSL command\n```openssl pkcs12 -export -out <NEW_KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME> -inkey <PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_NAME> -in <PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE_FILE_NAME> -certfile <COMPLETE_CERT_CHAIN_FILE_NAME>```\n\nExample with file names:\n\n```openssl pkcs12 -export -out keystore_new.p12 -inkey private.pem -in cert.cer -certfile clientcertchain.pem```\n');return(h,y)=>(a(),o(n,null,{default:e(()=>[c(f,{cols:"12"},{default:e(()=>[s("div",{innerHTML:l(t)},null,8,p)]),_:1})]),_:1}))}});export{E as default};
